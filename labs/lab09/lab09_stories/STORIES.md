As a user, I want a to-do list application in which I can arrange tasks with my schedule in calender application.
- Tasks are listed in dot points
- When adding a new task, the user can choose to attach information like when and where
- Once added, it would appears in my calender applications if the user add time information to it
- Tasks can be save in a option list and add directly without creating again
- Tasks can be added automatically if the user set the time and frequency
- Tasks can also be described in images or digital hand painting
