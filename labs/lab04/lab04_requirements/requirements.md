Client:   
I really need you to build me a new system to help students see how many available seats there are on campus. Could you make it?

Engineer:  
May I know the capacity of the students that may be involved in this system? Also, which areas do you want the system to cover of the campus?

Client:  
Current enrollment of UNSW is 62509 students. I need it to cover all faculties of undergraduate.

Engineer:  
Besides checking the availability of free space on campus, are there any other functions you want the system to include in?

Client:  
The total number of seats needs to be counted, we will tell you later. Another important feature is that we want to connect this system to mobile applications so that students can view it anywhere.

Engineer:  
No problem. Do you also want a website platform for it?

Client:  
Yes. Can you merge this website platform into ‘myUNSW’ ？


Engineer:  
Of course we can do that for you, but additional charge may be cost. Is that okay for you?

Client:  
No problem. I have sufficient funds. Let's sign the contract.
